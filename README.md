# About this project
This is the first project on the course "React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. React Router & Redux)" by Academind (Maximilian Schwarzmüller) available on Udemy.
It is written in React (duh).
This project is being developed in tandem with the course, with some alterations where I diverge from the original course so as to explore and try out new things.
Since it is the first project, it is pretty basic. Great as a starting point.

## How to run
Download or clone the repository. Open the folder where you cloned/unzipped the project, run `npm install`, and when it finishes, run `npm run dev` and click on the link that will appear on the terminal.

Have fun!
